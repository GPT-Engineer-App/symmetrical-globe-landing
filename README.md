# symmetrical-globe-landing

A monochrome, gradient landing page. In the centre is a large, rotating, 3d globe. Above is the text: a white, bold, lowercase,"teleses.ai, coming soon" with a countdown to Sat Jul 27 2024 that says countdown to demo day. 

Make sure this works no matter who views it as it is serverless, so use system time or a global time api or sometihng that is credible.

Everything is neatly centred and aligned centrewise. 100% symmetrical.
